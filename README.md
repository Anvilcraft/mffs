# Modular Force Field Systems

MFFS contains a series of machines focused on converting energy to Forton for the use in generating force fields. The primary machine is a force field projector which is fed by capacitors and generators. The projector can be modified with cards and upgrades in order to change logic. These upgrades include several field shapes, size scaling, position offset, and utility modules. For example, the upgrade to shock attacks, kill monsters, remove blocks, and protect tiles.
